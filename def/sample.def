# This is a sample TagReport HTML template file.
# Comments are ONLY prefixed with #. Whitespace is ignored.

# For this part of the file there are certain special strings
# that are automatically replaced.
# $directory - directory you told TagReport to scan
# $date - date in HH:MM YY/MM/DD form
# $count - total count of songs

# This will be the title of the page.
title = "TagReport Generated Playlist ($directory)"

# This will be in between </title> and </head>. It is usually blank
# but is useful for integrating scripts or style sheets.
headbody = ""

# This is the body tag. Defaults to this if not specified. All usual
# substitution rules apply.
bodytag = "<body bgcolor="#000000" text="#FFFFFF">\n"

# This will appear before stats, but after the body tag.
header = "<h2>\nPlaylist of $directory\n</h2><hr />"

# This could essentially be merged into header, but for sake of organization
# it is separate.
stats = "<p>$count songs scanned on $date.</p>"

prebody = "<table>\n<tr><th>Artist</th><th>Song Title</th></tr>"

# body is special because it only recognizes two substitutions:
# $artist - Artist of the current song
# $title - Title of the current song
#
# If a song has no tag or an incomplete one, only $title will be filled, and
# $artist will be empty.
#
# body will be written to the file (with substitutions made) for each song,
# so in this case it is a complete table row.

body = "<tr><td>$artist</td><td>$title</td></tr>"

# This recognizes the header substitutions.
footer = "</table>\n<hr /><p><i>Generated By TagReport</i></p>"
