TagReport installation
----------------------

1. Prerequisites

* GNU make ('make' on a Linux system, 'gmake' on others)
* GNU g++, or any other ISO C++ compiler, probably works..
* flex and bison (any recent versions should do)
* Some kind of getopt implementation. (i.e. libgnugetopt in FreeBSD or as
  part of GNU libc)

At least one of the following:

* libFLAC (part of the flac distribution) if you want FLAC support
  Retrievable at http://flac.sourceforge.net or libflac-dev in Debian
* libvorbisfile. Part of libvorbis-dev in Debian or at:
    http://xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download.html
* libid3tag. Part of libid3tag0-dev in Debian or at:
    http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/
* TagLib. Find the source at:
    http://ktown.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/taglib-0.95.tar.gz

2. Method

If you installed TagLib in one of these directories:

	/opt /usr/local /usr
	
run ./configure without arguments.

If not, invoke run ./configure --with-taglib-prefix= and what you passed
as --prefix to the TagLib configure script. For example, if for TagLib you
configured it with --prefix=/usr/opt, then for TagReport run ./configure
--with-taglib-prefix=/usr/opt. Of course you may also specify a special
prefix for TagReport with --prefix. See ./configure --help for more info.

When configure has finished run make, and if necessary become the superuser,
and run make install.

3. Problems

If again you installed TagLib into a special place, and you get something like
this:

$ ./tagreport
/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libtag.so.0" not found

You must either add that place to /etc/ld.so.conf or set the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to that path. For example:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/usr/lib ./tagreport
