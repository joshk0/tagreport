TagReport installation
----------------------

1. Prerequisites

* GNU make ('make' on a Linux system, 'gmake' on others)
* GNU g++, or any other ISO C++ compiler, probably works..
* flex and bison (any recent versions should do)
* Some kind of getopt implementation. (i.e. libgnugetopt in FreeBSD or as
  part of GNU libc)

At least one of the following:

* libFLAC (part of the flac distribution) if you want FLAC support
  Retrievable at http://flac.sourceforge.net or libflac-dev in Debian
* libvorbisfile. Part of libvorbis-dev in Debian or at:
    http://xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download.html
* libid3tag. Part of libid3tag0-dev in Debian or at:
    http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/
* TagLib. Please retrieve the source from:

    http://ktown.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/taglib-cvs.tar.gz

  There has not been a formal release yet. It's highly alpha code, and
  does not even build on Solaris. So watch out! TagLib provides for when
  libvorbis and libid3tag are unavailable.

2. Method

If you installed TagLib in one of these directories:

	/opt /usr/local /usr
	
run ./configure without arguments.

If not, invoke run ./configure --with-taglib-prefix= and what you passed
as --prefix to the TagLib configure script. For example, if for TagLib you
configured it with --prefix=/usr/opt, then for TagReport run ./configure
--with-taglib-prefix=/usr/opt. Of course you may also specify a special
prefix for TagReport with --prefix. See ./configure --help for more info.

When configure has finished run make, and if necessary become the superuser,
and run make install.

3. Problems

If again you installed TagLib into a special place, and you get something like
this:

$ ./tagreport
/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libtag.so.0" not found

You must either add that place to /etc/ld.so.conf or set the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to that path. For example:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/usr/lib ./tagreport
