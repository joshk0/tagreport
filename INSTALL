TagReport installation
----------------------

1. Prerequisites

* GNU make ('make' on a Linux system, 'gmake' on others)
* GNU g++, or any other ISO C++ compiler, probably works..
* flex and bison (any recent versions should do)
* Some kind of getopt implementation.
* libFLAC (part of the flac distribution) if you want FLAC support
* TagLib. Please retrieve the source from:

    http://ktown.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/taglib-cvs.tar.gz

  There has not been a formal release yet. It's highly alpha code, and
  even does not build on Solaris. So watch out!

2. Method

If you installed TagLib in one of these directories:

	/opt /usr/local /usr
	
run ./configure without arguments.

If not, invoke run ./configure --with-taglib-prefix= and what you passed
as --prefix to the TagLib configure script. For example, if for TagLib you
configured it with --prefix=/usr/opt, then for TagReport run ./configure
--with-taglib-prefix=/usr/opt. Of course you may also specify a special
prefix for TagReport with --prefix. See ./configure --help for more info.

When configure has finished run make, and if necessary become the superuser,
and run make install.

3. Problems

If again you installed TagLib into a special place, and you get something like
this:

$ ./tagreport
/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libtag.so.0" not found

You must either add that place to /etc/ld.so.conf or set the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to that path. For example:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/usr/lib ./tagreport
